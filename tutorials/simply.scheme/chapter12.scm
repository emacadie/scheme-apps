;; Maybe I am not very good at this yet, but the "Leap Of Faith" sounds like it can become a Death March

;; 12.1  Here is a definition of a procedure that returns the sum of the numbers in its argument sentence:

(define (addup nums)
  (if (empty? (bf nums))
      (first nums)
      (+ (first nums) (addup (bf nums)))))

;; Although this works, it could be simplified by changing the base case. Do that.
(define (my-addup nums)
  (if (empty? nums)
      0
      (+ (first nums) (my-addup (bf nums)))))

;; 12.2  Fix the bug in the following definition:

(define (acronym sent)                       ;; wrong
  (if (= (count sent) 1)
      (first sent)
      (word (first (first sent))
	    (acronym (bf sent)))))

(define (my-acronym sent)
  (if (= (count sent) 1)
      (first (first sent))
      (word (first (first sent)) (my-acronym (bf sent)))))

;; 12.3  Can we reduce the factorial base case argument from 0 to -1? 
;; If so, show the resulting procedure. If not, why not?
;; multiplying by 0 would result in 0

;;  12.4  Here's the definition of a function f:
;; math display
;; Implement f as a Scheme procedure. What does f do? 
;; it reverses a list, I think
(define (ffunc sent)
  (if (empty? sent) 
      '()
      (sentence (ffunc (butfirst sent)) (first sent))))

;; 12.5  [8.8] Write an exaggerate procedure which exaggerates sentences:

;; > (exaggerate '(i ate 3 potstickers))
; (I ATE 6 POTSTICKERS)
;; > (exaggerate '(the chow fun is good here))
;; (THE CHOW FUN IS GREAT HERE)
;; It should double all the numbers in the sentence, and it should replace "good" with "great," "bad" with "terrible," and anything else you can think of.

;; 12.6  [8.11] Write a GPA procedure. It should take a sentence of grades as its argument and return the corresponding grade point average:

;; 3.67
;; Hint: write a helper procedure base-grade that takes a grade as argument and returns 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4,

  (cond ((equal? (last grade) '+) 0.33)

;; I did not do tail recursion. But then again, the authors did not mention tail-recursion.
;; I don't think I got it when I did the other Scheme tutorials.
;; But I was able to use loop-recur in Clojure, and I think that is similar to tail-recursion:
;; from https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#recur
;; "recur in other than a tail position is an error."
;; The page also says it is not tail-call optimized, and the only thing to look out for is that you are not using an infinite sequence:
;; "There is no tail-call optimization and the use of self-calls for looping of unknown bounds is discouraged."
;; I wonder if there is a library that can check your recursive calls.
