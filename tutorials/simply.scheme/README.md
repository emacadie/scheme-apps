repo for "Simply Scheme": https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html  

Why? It claims to be a prequel to SICP   

I think their code is GPL. I have tried to make a few small changes to get it to work in Kawa. But I don't think it's worth it to get it to work in Kawa. It does work with csi and guile.   

database.scm, functions.scm, match.scm, newttt.scm, simply.scm, spread.scm and ttt.scm from https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/downloads/simply/ I could not find links to them on the "Simply Scheme" site. I found them through a Google search.   

You load simply.scm first    
(load-relative "./simply.scm")   
(load-relative "./functions.scm")
