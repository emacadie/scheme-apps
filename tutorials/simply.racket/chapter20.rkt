;; Chapter 20 Input and Output

;; talks about effects vs values
;; introduces the "begin" special form
#|
Quote from the book defining functions and procedures:
Sequencing and side effects are radical departures from the idea of functional programming. 
In fact, we'd like to reserve the name function for something that computes and returns one value, with no side effects. 
"Procedure" is the general term for the thing that lambda returnsâ€”an embodiment of an algorithm. 
If the algorithm is the kind that computes and returns a single value without side effects, then we say that the procedure implements a function.

;; There is some stuff about show, display and newline
;; Introduces strings
;; Introduces concept of "higher order procedure", like HOF with functions
;; so "for-each" is like "map" for when you need to print
;; unlike "map" it will not return a new list
;; plus, while the return list of "map" is in the correct order, 
;; it might not execute the elements in the right order
;; for HOP, we might care about order
