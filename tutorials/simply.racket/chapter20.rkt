;; Chapter 20 Input and Output

;; talks about effects vs values
;; introduces the "begin" special form
#|
Quote from the book defining functions and procedures:
Sequencing and side effects are radical departures from the idea of functional programming. 
In fact, we'd like to reserve the name function for something that computes and returns one value, with no side effects. 
"Procedure" is the general term for the thing that lambda returnsâ€”an embodiment of an algorithm. 
If the algorithm is the kind that computes and returns a single value without side effects, then we say that the procedure implements a function.

;; There is some stuff about show, display and newline
;; I think show is like display in that it adds a newline at the end
;; You still get a newline from display at the REPL
;; Introduces strings
;; Introduces concept of "higher order procedure", like HOF with functions
;; so "for-each" is like "map" for when you need to print
;; unlike "map" it will not return a new list
;; plus, while the return list of "map" is in the correct order, 
;; it might not execute the elements in the right order
;; for HOP, we might care about order

They say "align" is not part of standard Scheme, so here is their paragraph on it
Align takes three arguments. 
The first is the value to be displayed. 
The second is the width of the column in which it will be displayed; the returned value will be a word with that many characters in it. 
The third argument is the number of digits that should be displayed to the right of the decimal point. 
(If this number is zero, then no decimal point will be displayed.) 
The width must be great enough to include all the digits, as well as the decimal point and minus sign, if any.
