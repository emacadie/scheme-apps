;; I did not do tail recursion. But then again, the authors did not mention tail-recursion.
;; I don't think I got it when I did the other Scheme tutorials.
;; But I was able to use loop-recur in Clojure, and I think that is similar to tail-recursion:
;; from https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#recur
;; "recur in other than a tail position is an error."
;; The page also says it is not tail-call optimized, and the only thing to look out for is that you are not using an infinite sequence:
;; "There is no tail-call optimization and the use of self-calls for looping of unknown bounds is discouraged."
;; I wonder if there is a library that can check your recursive calls.

;; In the Shido tutorial, Shido will have a wrapper procedure that calls the tail-recursive procedure.
;; Also, look here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13664639/tail-recursive-functions-in-scheme

(define (factorial X)
      (cond
            ((eqv? X 1) 1)
            ((number? X)(* X (factorial (- X 1))))))
Not tail-recursive since the inner call to factorial is used in a call to *

Tail-recursive:
(define (factorial x acc)
  (if (zero? x)
      acc
      (factorial (sub1 x) (* x acc))))
The last call to factorial is not tail-recursive because it is on the last line, 
but because its result is not fed into another function.
