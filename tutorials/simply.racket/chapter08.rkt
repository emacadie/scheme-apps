;; 8.4  Write a procedure choose-beatles that takes a predicate function as its argument and returns a sentence of just those Beatles (John, Paul, George, and Ringo) that satisfy the predicate. 
;; so this sounds like filter/keep
(define (choose-beatles func)
  (keep func (se 'john 'paul 'george 'ringo)))
;; because "sentence" makes it a list
;; For example:

;; 8.5  Write a procedure transform-beatles that takes a procedure as an argument, applies it to each of the Beatles, and returns the results in a sentence:
;; this sounds like map, aka every
(define (transform-beatles func)
  (every func (se 'john 'paul 'george 'ringo)))


;; 8.6  When you're talking to someone over a noisy radio connection, you sometimes have to spell out a word in order to get the other person to understand it. 
;; But names of letters aren't that easy to understand either, 
;; so there's a standard code in which each letter is represented by a particular word that starts with the letter. For example, instead of "B" you say "bravo."

;; Write a procedure words that takes a word as its argument and returns a sentence of the names of the letters in the word:

;; (You may make up your own names for the letters or look up the standard ones if you want.)

;; Hint: Start by writing a helper procedure that figures out the name for a single letter.
;; a map would come in handy here

;; to get the letters of a word:
;; (define (single letter) (word letter))
(define (nato-letter letter)
  (cond [(equal? letter 'a) 'alpha]
        [(equal? letter 'b) 'bravo]
        [(equal? letter 'c) 'charlie]
        [(equal? letter 'd) 'delta]
        ((equal? letter 'e) 'echo)        
        [else 'null]))
;; I could go to the end, but what's the point? 
(define (words the-word)
  (every nato-letter the-word))

;;  8.7  [14.5][9] Write a procedure letter-count that takes a sentence as its argument and returns the total number of letters in the sentence:
;; sounds like reduce, aka accumulate
(define (letter-count the-sentence) 
  (accumulate + (every count the-sentence)))

;; 8.8  [12.5] Write an exaggerate procedure which exaggerates sentences:

;; It should double all the numbers in the sentence, and it should replace "good" with "great," "bad" with "terrible," and anything else you can think of.
;; sounds like every with a dash of cond
;; only works with lower-case
;; do-great-stuff in more-simply
(define (exaggerate sntnc)
  (every more:do-great-stuff sntnc))

;; 8.9  What procedure can you use as the first argument to every so that for any sentence used as the second argument, every returns that sentence?
;; I tried "word" and it worked
;; What procedure can you use as the first argument to keep so that for any sentence used as the second argument, keep returns that sentence?
;; I tried "word?" and it worked
;; What procedure can you use as the first argument to accumulate so that for any sentence used as the second argument, accumulate returns that sentence?
;; I tried "sentence" and it worked

;; 8.10  Write a predicate true-for-all? that takes two arguments, a predicate procedure and a sentence. It should return #t if the predicate argument returns true for every word in the sentence.
(define (true-for-all? pred sntnc)
  (cond [(equal? (count sntnc) (count (keep pred sntnc)))]
        [else #f]))

;; 8.11  [12.6] Write a GPA procedure. It should take a sentence of grades as its argument and return the corresponding grade point average:
;; Hint: write a helper procedure base-grade that takes a grade as argument and returns 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, 
;; and another helper procedure grade-modifier that returns âˆ’.33, 0, or .33, depending on whether the grade has a minus, a plus, or neither.
;; base-grade and modify-grade in more-simply

(define (convert-grade-to-num grade)
  (+ (more:base-grade grade) (more:modify-grade grade)))

(define (gpa grades)
  (/ (accumulate + (every convert-grade-to-num grades)) (count grades)))

;; 8.12  [11.2] When you teach a class, people will get distracted if you say "um" too many times. 
;; Write a count-ums that counts the number of times "um" appears in a sentence:
(define (is-um wd)
  (equal? 'um wd))

(define (count-ums sntnc)
  (count (keep is-um sntnc)))

;; 8.13  [11.3] Write a procedure phone-unspell that takes a spelled version of a phone number, such as POPCORN, 
;; and returns the real phone number, in this case 7672676. 
;; You will need to write a helper procedure that uses an 8-way cond expression to translate a single letter into a digit.

; phone-letter in more-simply, also used in chapter 11
(define (phone-unspell wd)
  (every more:phone-letter wd))

;; 8.14  Write the procedure subword that takes three arguments: a word, a starting position number, and an ending position number. 
;; It should return the subword containing only the letters between the specified positions:
(define (subword wd start fin)
  ((repeated butfirst (- start 1)) ((repeated butlast (- (count wd) fin)) wd)))
